These appliances are dual CPU systems with the [Intel E5-2600 v3/v4](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/series/59138/intel-xeon-processor-e5-family.html) (Haswell/Broadwell-EP) family processors with Wellsburg PCH. They ustilise Enhanced Intel SpeedStepÂ® Technology and the motherboards support it but the Bios was crippled and so cannot be used. Using the standard bios, you will see references on boot that the CPU supports the advanced features but cannot be enabled. A modded bios solves this problem and allows for the OS to throttle the processor frequency to conserve power.
